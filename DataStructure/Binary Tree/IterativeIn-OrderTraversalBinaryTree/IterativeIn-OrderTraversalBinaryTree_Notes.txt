In this technique, before visiting the root node 1, first we have to visit its left of tree then we have to visit the node 1 and after visiting the node 1 then we have visit its right of tree.

When we have to start with node 1, we have to go to its left of tree first and there is no way we can visit the node 1 again and therefore we need additional data structure which can hold this node 1, so that once we complete visiting its left of tree then we can pull the node 1 from the additional data structure and can visit it. After visiting node 1, we can go to its right of tree.

The additional data structure here we used is stack which is a LIFO data structure.

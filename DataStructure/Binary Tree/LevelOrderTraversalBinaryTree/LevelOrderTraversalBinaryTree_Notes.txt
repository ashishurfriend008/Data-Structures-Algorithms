This technique is used to visit the nodes of binary tree level by level. Root i.e.1 is at level 0 and 2,3 are at level 1 and 4,5,6 are at level 2.

In this traversal technique, we first visit level 0 and then we visit level 1 and then we visit the level 2. The data will be printed in the console like 1,2,3,4,5,6. When we do a level order traversal of a particular level then we actually stores elements of its next level on additional data structure which is nothing but the queue.

Suppose we are visiting node 1, on the queue we put node 2 and node 3, so after visiting node 1 we can pull node 2 and node 3. Similarly, when we visit node 2, we put node 4 and node 5 on the queue. And, when we are visiting node 3, we put node 6 on the queue, so therefore it goes level by level.Additional data structure which we used is the queue because it is a FIFO data structure i.e. the element inserted first which is the first one to be removed.

Binary Tree 
-----------
Tree is an non linear data structure which is used for storing the data.It is made up of nodes and edges without
having any cycle.Nodes are connected to other nodes through edges but they never form a cycle.Each node in a tree
can point to n number of nodes in a tree which can be referred by any node.Usually tree is representng the hierarchial 
structure where the parent node is called as root.So , whenever we represent a tree usually the first node which is the 
parent of all other node is generally referred as root.Also , the node which is not pointing any other node is called
as leaf.Node 1 is the parent of 2 , 9 and 3.Node 2 is parent of 4 and 5 and node 4 has no child , so therefore it is called
as leaf nodes.A binary tree is special kind of children where each node has 0 , 1 or 2 children but not more then that.
A node can have one children and other children can point to null.Basically , a binary tree is represented by TreeNode.
TreeNode consists of three things data , left and right.It is a pointer to Left node and pointer to Right node.These pointers 
are TreeNode itself.A binary tree represent basically through a TreeNode.A TreeNode contains data , pointer to the 
left TreeNode and pointer to the right TreeNode.Initially the left and right pointers points to null and latter on we make 
them refer to other TreeNode.

When we initialize a binary tree the root is pointing to null and the root is type of TreeNode.Suppose , we want to insert a temp 
in the binary tree we simply assign the value of temp to the root.

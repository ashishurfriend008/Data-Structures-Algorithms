In Top down approach, we are passing a memo array which helps us in storing the solution to the sub problems and when the sub problems are encountered again instead of recalculating it we just go to the integer array into that particular index and we pick up that value and reuse it. Thus, this memo integer array helps us in optimizing the recursion solutions. This method also takes the value of n for which we find the fibonacci number.

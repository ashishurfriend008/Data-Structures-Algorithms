>> Stack is a linear data structure because it can be represented by linked list or an array in which the nodes are adjacent to each other.

>> We used PUSH and POP operations to add and remove elements from the Stack.

>> Stack is basically a one way list. That means, inserting node at the one end and other end is blocked. So, there is one end to PUSH and POP the elements.

>> Stack is a Last In First Out data strcuture i.e.LIFO.

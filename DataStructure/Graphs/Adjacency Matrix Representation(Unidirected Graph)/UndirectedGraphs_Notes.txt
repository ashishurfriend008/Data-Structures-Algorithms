If we are in vertex 3 than we can go to vertex 4 and vice versa. The graph which has two way edges is termed as undirected graph. For ex, social networking graph can be seen as undirected graph.

Graph can be represented as two dimensional array which is nothing but the matrix. In matrix, where ever you put an edge you put 1 and if there is no edge then you put 0.

Create a two dimensional array which will be the adjacency matrix and it would represent a graph.Suppose the Graph has four nodes than it will be a 4 * 4 matrix. Here, u is the uth row and v is the vth column.

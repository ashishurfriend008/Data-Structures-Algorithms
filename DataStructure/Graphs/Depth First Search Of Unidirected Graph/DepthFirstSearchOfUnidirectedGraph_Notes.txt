Here, the edges don't have any direction, so it is unidirected graph. We pass in the source node i.e. the value of s will become 0(starting point). Whenever we traverse over unidirected graph we usually keep the track of its nodes through the boolean array i.e. which node is visited and which node is not. The size is the number of vertices we pass through boolean array. In order to perform depth for search of unidirected graph we usually take the help of stack. The stack data structure is nothing but LIFO DS i.e. last in first out. So the elements inserted last will be the first one to be removed.
